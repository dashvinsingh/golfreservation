    p style="font-size:17px;margin:3%;" <i>"Mathnasium helped me to get into the university of my dreams! Before, I was struggling with grade 12 advanced functions and much could be said about my performance on tests. Fortunately, with the support of the amazing staff at Mathnasium, I not only performed better on tests, but also developed sustainable study habits that will carry me through to university and beyond. Thank you Mathnasium!"</i>

    p style="font-size:17px;margin:3%;" <i>"Our two boys joined the program around a year ago. The elder one was struggling in Maths earlier but with Mathnasium support, he has improved a lot and it showed in his grade 10 result. We strongly feel that both of them are gaining confidence in maths. The staff is helpful and take time to explain the problem. Vineet and Sunaina are very understanding and flexible in their approach. We are very pleased with the experience."</i>
